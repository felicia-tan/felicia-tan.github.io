I'm Felicia. I currently conduct human-computer interaction research at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) ([NUS-HCI lab](https://www.nus-hci.org/)), and previously worked with tech startups and VC. I'm plagued by insatiable intellectual hunger and entrepreneurial spirit, though I'd rather describe myself as a quiet artist at heart. Music and depth psychology are the two main portals by which I access my interior experience, and the collective human psyche.

I'm too fond of my strings (guitar, violin), the ocean, Carl Jung and all things soulful. Through writing, I hope to send equal love to my left and right brain, and maybe, hopefully, I could be a part of this movement towards planetary healing.

Reach out anytime, and thanks for reading!
